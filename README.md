    Questions

What is network difficulty and how does it affect mining? Difficulty affects blockmining sucess rate - higher difficulty = more shares

Is the varying difficulty of a network random? Random within a limit

What is pool difficulty? 1 diff = 1 share - the higher the difficulty the less often shares are submitted. Shares with low difficulty are worth less than high difficulty shares.

What causes invalid shares? OC settings, high temps, unstable blockchains or wifi connections

What does T in Network difficulty mean? Terrahashes (1k*gh/s)

What is the difference between Cuda8 and Cuda9 for NVIDIA gpus? 8 = compute 2.0-6.x, 9 =  compute 3.0-7x with Volta suport

What does pool difficulty really mean / overall pool hash? Less people mining on a pool means that your share % increases = more /block
