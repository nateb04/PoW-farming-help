## FAQ

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What is network difficulty and how does it affect mining? | Difficulty affects blockmining sucess rate - higher difficulty = more shares |
| Is the varying difficulty of a network random?  | Random within a limit |
| What is pool difficulty?  | 1 diff = 1 share - the higher the difficulty the less often shares are submitted. Shares with low difficulty are worth less than high difficulty shares. |
| What causes invalid shares?   | OC settings, high temps, unstable blockchains or wifi connections |
| What does T in Network difficulty mean? | Terrahashes (1k gh/s) |
| What does pool difficulty really mean / overall pool hash? | Less people mining on a pool means that your share % increases = more /block |
| What is a DAG epoch?  | Ethhash uses DAG which is generated for each epoch (30,000 blocks or 100 hours) so a DAG can be generated in advanced to avoid long wait epoch transitions |
